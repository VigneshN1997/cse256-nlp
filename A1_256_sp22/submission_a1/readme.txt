The code being submitted is a jupyter notebook containing experiments conducted for both 2.1 and 2.2.
the code is in cse256_a1_vignesh.ipynb
Ignore the other generated files
Initial code is copied from classify.py and sentiment.py

Libraries used:
- sklearn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- nltk
- spacy
- textblob
- tqdm
- seaborn



The notebook is demarcated into 2 sections for 2.1 and 2.2.
All the cells of the notebook can be run in order to get the results for 2.1 and 2.2

For 2.1:
- grid search
- grid search best results
- iterating over n and C values for plotting graphs for training and dev sets
- accuracy vs C plots
- showing performance on best n and C values

For 2.2:
- checking label distribtion to see if there is any skew in dataset
- helper functions defined for adding new features
- loading dataset as pandas dataframe
- visualising distributions of new features added for both labels
- trying out different tokenizers
- trying out new feature additions to the data
